Hi there! I'm Aeirya, a 23-year-old with a passion for languages and technology. My journey into linguistics started early thanks to Middle Persian roots of my name, and mythology. 

Exploring languages has been a lifelong fascination for me. From delving into Japanese and French to uncovering the nuances of Norwegian and Chinese. I've enjoyed diving deep into more than a dozen languages and dialects, such as Gilaki dialects. My linguistic adventures extend to exploring various writings systems, from Cyrillic to Hebrew. Alongside this passion, I've also immersed myself in technology, dabbling in programming languages, and game development.

Drawn to science and engineering, I participated in the National Chemistry Olympiad, then entered Chemical Engineering program, before realizing my true potential and passion lies in Computer Science. I consider myself fortunate to be living in a time of rapid advancements in natural language processing.

Beyond academics, I enjoy activities like basketball, swimming, board and video games, and playing six musical instruments. Recently, I've also started exploring Yoga, cooking, psychology, neuroscience  and cognitive science concepts, and more of linguistics. I believe in finding a balance between work and personal journey, valuing each experience as an opportunity to learn and grow.
