(I didn't have much time to refine this text, but GPT san <a href="/aboutmegpt.md">did</a>.)

I am Aeirya, a 23 years old person with a Middle Persian (Pahlavi) name that dragged me into linguistics and mythology very early in life. Ever since I went to school I studied more than a dozen of languages (Chinese, Korean, Kurdish, Norwegian, German, Latin, ...), dialects (Gilaki, Mazandarani, Lebanese, Khouzestani Arabic) and writings (Cyrlic, Aramic, Hebrew, ...) in my free time and as a hobby. 

My other activity was programming and computer technology. I got to learn game development with Unity3D, 3D modeling, web and software development and other side skills which always come back to me whenever I'm trying to make myself apps and tools.

My love for science and engineering led me to the National Chemistry Olympiad and later, Chemical Engineering major, but my passion led me to Computer Science, which is where I had always dreamt of dedicating my academic life to.

I am so lucky to be born in a time where I can be a part of the natural language processing revolution, and to be equipped with neccessary tools along the way.

As an ever-energetic and cheerful person, I love lots of physical activities such as basketball, swimming, skating, and mental activities such as chess, videogames and boardgames, specially if such activity makes me closer to people and help me socialize even stronger.
And as of now, I've started my inner journey with Yoga and cooking, and my outer journey with finally jumping to my dream field of computational linguistics, and reading papers, some of which thrill me to no end. Studying in the most comptetitive unviersity in Iran has made me rethink my purpose of my life, which is why I believe is making balance between work and job.

As a person with an obviously high amount of intrests, I believe I have been able to transfer my knowledge and perspective I gain in each experience, and no path ventured is a waste for one who can learn from it.
