Greetings! My name is Aeirya Mohammadi. I'm currently a computer science undergraduate, interested in all sorts of stuff, like languages and linguistics, science, and computers. 

I'm currently stepping into the field of NLP and computational linguistics, which I've found to be the reason I've come on such a long journey. Previously I was invested in computer architecture and systems and, before that, software engineering. All of which I still find intriguing, but for computers and languages, I do have an inner guide.

I used to study for the chemistry olympiad as a hobby and was admitted as a chemical engineering student first. It was actually so much fun, and I can't wait to write about it, but it was still not the thing I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

So... about languages, I can only confidently speak two: English and Persian. I can get a few more, though. 

Where I come from, Iran, we study Arabic back in school for about 6 years, which is quite some time. I remember once translating footage of news which everybody found quite impressive.  

As an otaku and someone who's interested in Japan, I've adopted quite a lot of Japanese expressions. I've been studying Japanese more seriously recently, and I believe I'm finally getting some results.

French has always been one of my favorite languages to study, and knowing English; it's not that hard trying to comprehend French texts. 

Other languages which I have tried learning include German, Spanish, Norwegian, Chinese, Russian, Turkish, and a small amount of Hebrew, Esperanto, Italian, Ido, Dutch, and Latin.

Recently I've been trying to learn a bit of Kurdish from my friends and Gilaki. The latter is the domestic language of our small province. Seeing these smaller Iranian languages made me think I have the responsibility to save them. You can find the tools I'm developing for Gilaki in my GitHub.

I guess I talked a little too much. I will stop right here.

Hang in there!

Aeirya
