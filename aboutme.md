(I didn't have much time to refine this text, but GPT san <a href="/aboutmegpt.md">did</a>).

This is a very brief story mostly about my linguistics journey. For (academic) projects and experience check my <a href="/research.md">research</a>.

I am Aeirya, a 23-year-old person with a Middle Persian (Pahlavi) name that dragged me into linguistics and mythology very early in life. Ever since I went to school I studied more than a dozen languages (Chinese, Korean, Kurdish, Norwegian, German, Latin, ...), dialects (Gilaki, Mazandarani, Lebanese, Khouzestani Arabic), and writings (Cyrlic, Aramaic, Hebrew, ...) in my free time and as a hobby. 

My other activity was programming and computer technology. I got to learn game development with Unity3D, 3D modeling, web and software development, and other side skills that always come back to me whenever I'm trying to make myself apps and tools.

My love for science and engineering led me to the National Chemistry Olympiad and later, the Chemical Engineering major, but my passion led me to Computer Science, which is where I had always dreamt of dedicating my academic life.

I am so lucky to be born in a time where I can be a part of the natural language processing revolution, and be equipped with necessary tools along the way.

As an ever-energetic and cheerful person, I love lots of physical activities such as basketball, swimming, skating, and mental activities such as chess, video games, and board games, especially if such activity makes me closer to people and helps me socialize even stronger.
As of now, I've started my inner journey with Yoga and cooking, and my outer journey with finally jumping to my dream field of computational linguistics, and reading papers, some of which thrill me to no end. Studying in the most competitive university in Iran has made me rethink my purpose in life, which is why I believe in making a balance between work and job.

As a person with a high amount of interests, I believe I have been able to transfer the knowledge and perspective I gain in each experience, and no path ventured is a waste for one who can learn from it.
