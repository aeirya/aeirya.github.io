Greetings! My name is Aeirya Mohammadi. I'm currently a computer science undergraduate, interested in all sorts of stuff, like languages and linguistics, science, and computers. 

### Education
I'm currently stepping into the field of NLP and computational linguistics, which I've found to be why I've come on such a long journey. Previously I was invested in computer architecture and systems and, before that, software engineering. All of which I still find intriguing, but nothing clicks for me like languages.

I used to study for the chemistry olympiad as a hobby. I remember having to learn so many new things in a short period. Those were some of the best days of my life. I was later admitted as a chemical engineering student. Actually, It was so much fun, and I can't wait to write about it, but it was still not the thing I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

### Languages
So... about languages, I can only confidently speak two: English and Persian. I can get a few more, though. 

Where I come from, Iran, we study Arabic back in school for about six years, which is quite some time. I remember once translating footage of news which everybody found quite impressive. 

As an otaku and someone interested in Japan, I've adopted many Japanese expressions. I've been studying Japanese more seriously recently, and I got a tutor, and I believe I'm finally getting some results.

French has always been one of my favorite languages to study, and knowing English; it's not that hard trying to comprehend French texts. Currently, I'm attending a French course at the university.

Other languages which I have tried learning include German, Spanish, Norwegian, Chinese, Russian, Turkish, and Korean, and a small amount of Hebrew, Esperanto, Italian, Ido, Dutch, and Latin.

Recently, I've been trying to learn a bit of Kurdish from my friends and Gilaki. The latter is the domestic language of our small province. Seeing these smaller Iranian languages made me think I am responsible for saving them. You can find the tools I'm developing for Gilaki in my GitHub.

I guess I talked a little too much. I will stop right here.

Hang in there!

Aeirya

P.S.: Here are a few shots of me.

<!-- To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
